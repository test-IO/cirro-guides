## Contributing

### Writing Content

To write content for the Test IO Guides, you need to have a basic understanding of Markdown (more precisely Markdoc) and Git. If you are not familiar with these, please read the following guides:

- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
- [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)
- [Git Handbook - Pull Requests](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request)
- [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/)

You will find all the content in the `src` folder. The content is written in Markdown and is organized in folders and files. The folder structure is as follows:

```bash
├── src
│   ├── pages   # Markdown files for the pages
│   ├── images  # Images for the pages
│   ├── data    # Sidebar navigation links
```

---

If you want to embed **code snippets**, you can use the following syntax:

````Markdown
{% code language="ruby" showLineNumbers=true %}
```
x = 7.days.ago
```
{% /code %}
````

---

All pages by default show a **table of contents** on the right. You can disable this by adding `hideTableOfContents: true` to the frontmatter of the page:

```Markdown
---
title: "Page Title"
hideTableOfContents: true
---
```

This will expand the content to the full width of the page.

---

### Writing Code

To contribute to the Test IO Guides application (this repository), you need to have a basic understanding of JavaScript (Next.js), Markdoc, TailwindCSS, and Yarn. Git(Hub) proficiency is presumed. If you are not familiar with these, please read the following guides:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started)
- [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)

To get started, first run `bin/setup`. This will install all dependencies and set up the project. Then run `yarn dev` to start the development server. You can now access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  
To run the linter, run `bin/lint`. This requires markdownlint to be installed. To install it via Homebrew, run `brew install markdownlint-cli`.
