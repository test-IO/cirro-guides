## Fetch Test IO Bug by External Id

**Fetch Test IO Bug by External Id** search locates information for an exported bug using its corresponding ID in a bug tracker.

For example,

Jira is an external system to the Test IO platform, hence "Fetch Test IO Bug by External ID". This is useful when a Test IO bug is exported to a bug tracking system and its Test IO ID is unknown.
