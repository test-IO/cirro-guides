## Fetch Test IO Bug by External Id

**Fetch Test IO Bug by External Id** search fetches information for the exported bug using the ID of the bug in the bug tracker.

For example,

- Bug tracker: **Jira Cloud**

Jira is an external system to the Test IO platform, hence "Fetch Test IO Bug by External Id". This is useful when the Test IO bug is exported to a bug tracking system and you don't know the ID of this bug in Test IO.
