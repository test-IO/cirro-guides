With the new **AI Access** feature in the Cirro Developer Interface, you can easily request and manage API tokens for AI integrations. These tokens allow you to enhance your applications with AI capabilities like OpenAI. This feature is accessible through the Cirro UI and is designed to help developers streamline their API access needs.

## AI Access Requests

The **AI Access** feature provides a simple way to request API tokens for AI services. Each request corresponds to a set number of tokens, and once provisioned, these tokens will be displayed in your Cirro Developer Interface.

## Requesting API Tokens:

- To request tokens, go to the **Configure** tab and navigate to the **AI Access** section.
- Enter the number of tokens you need in the **Token Quantity** field (maximum 2 tokens).
- Once youâ€™ve entered a valid number, click the **Request AI tokens** button. This action triggers a request workflow.
- You will be able to see your provisioned tokens in the same interface once they have been added to the database.

## Managing API Tokens

Once your token has been provisioned, the **AI Access** section in the Cirro Developer Interface will display it with a unique ID. You can then manage your tokens directly from the interface.

## Token Management Options:

- **Copy Token**: Next to each token, there is a **copy icon** that allows you to quickly copy the token to your clipboard for easy integration into your application.
- **Re-generate Token**: You can regenerate the token if needed. This will deactivate the old token and generate a new one.
- **Revoke Token**: If a token is no longer needed, you can revoke it to ensure it is not misused.
