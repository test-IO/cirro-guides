## Mandatory information upon space creation
Upon creating your space, you need to provide some mandatory information. You are to define the **type of work** (or category) available within your space. There is a free text field available for this purpose, that offers a set list of options via autocomplete, but you can also create your own value. Please note, a space can have only one category. You need to add a **short description** of your space in a free text field. It is important to keep it short (there is a limit of 180 characters), as there is a separate rich text field to provide your **space description** with the possibility of uploading pictures. You need to provide your **interface languages** to be used. Languages (or locales) are displayed in a multi-select field and those already in use can be excluded from the select options.

Your space description needs to contain the **company name**, a **link** to a publicly available website or landing page, a **support contact email address** and **Social links**.

## Visibility
The **visibility** of your space is defined by community membership. Users with access to your space see a full, detailed description. For those without access, the space card is not visible at all. Upon following the link to the restricted space, a flash message is displayed for them.

Spaces are displayed in card view and detailed view. **Card view** contains limited information compared to detailed view:
  * type of work that is available within the space
  * 'Gigs available' with numeric details
  * 'Gigs completed' with numeric details
  * 'Details' link leading to the details page of the given space

**Detailed view** displays the following information: 
  * company name
  * type of work that is available within your space
  * information on when the user joined the given Space
  * short description
  * 'Gigs available' and 'Gigs completed' with numeric details
  * space description
  * contact information
  * supported interface languages

## Access 
Users can **join your space** either via card view by hitting 'Join' button. Upon joining a space this way, a flash message is displayed. The other access method is via the app details page by hitting the 'Join' button. This way, there is no flash message displayed.
