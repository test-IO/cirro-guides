title: Results & Rewards
description: Submitting results and rewarding Workers.
---
Once the users of your space have finished working on a task, thus completed a gig, they submit the results and get rewarded accordingly. Using our example space to demonstrate the case in practice - once your user (worker) has planted trees (gig results) in a tree planting event (gig) within a certain amount of time (gig time activitiy), they submit the verification of the process in order to get compensated. 

The work does not get rewarded automatically, it has to go through a review process by an approver. The approvers can either approve or reject the work done by users. Once the work is approved, your space submits the gig result and gig time activity to Cirro, that rewards your user accordingly. Your users are not compensated for their work rejected by the approver.
