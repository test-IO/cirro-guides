title: Space Invitations
description: Inviting users to your Space via Cirro.
---
You can use **Space Invitations** to invite users to join your space. Using our example space, you send an invitation email to volunteers to join your tree-planting site. Cirro allows you to create an invitation for which it sends out an invitation email. The invited user is then redirected to a URL included in the invite. Make sure not to leave the URL blank, otherwise the user you wish to invite gets redirected to your public URL, without being invited to your space. 

Apart from creating a space invitation, you can expire it also.
