title: Space Invitations
description: Inviting users to your Space via Cirro.
---

You can use **Space Invitations** to invite users to join your space. This should not be confused with invitations to Gigs. Using our example space, you can send an invitation email to a potential volunteer to join your tree-planting site. Cirro allows you to create an invitation for which it sends out an invitation email. If the invited user follows the link in the email, they will first hate to sign up (or in) to Cirro, before being redirected to your Space. This redirect will have the invitation token attached, so that your Space can identify the user and allow them to accept or decline the invitation.

You are responsible for ensuring consent from the invited user, for example by asking the inviting user for confirmation that they are allowed to email the recipient. When creating a Space Invitation you have to provide the name of the inviting user as well as the name of the group/project/organization/entity the user is being invited to.

You can also expire a Space Invitation via API.

The API documentation for Space Invitation can be found [here](https://api-docs.cirro.io/docs/space_invitations/about).
