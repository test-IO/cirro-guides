## What are Idempotency Keys?

An idempotency key is a unique value generated by the client, which is sent in the HTTP request. The server uses this key to recognize subsequent retries of the same request. The key has to be unique across the app/space. The key has to be deterministic, meaning that the same key should be generated for the same request every time.

## How are Idempotency Keys used in Cirro?

In Cirro, idempotency keys are used to ensure that a request is only processed once, even if it is sent multiple times. This is particularly important in operations that involve payouts or other financial transactions, where duplicate processing could have serious consequences.

Idempotency keys are optional to pass in requests. However, they are highly recommended for operations that involve Payouts and GigResults in Cirro. If a request is sent with an idempotency key, Cirro first checks if a Payout or a GigResult with that key already exists. If it does, the existing resource is returned and no new resource is created. If it doesn't, a new resource is created and the idempotency key is stored for future reference.
